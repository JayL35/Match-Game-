		<h1>XTreme Rock Paper Scissor</h1>
		<h2>Rock Paper Scissors is a common game people are familiar with and play. 
			However, the ordinary feature doesn't make the game people would play for a long period time. 	
			Now, building on top of Rock Paper Scissor is a new game XTreme Rock Paper Scissor. "XRPS is a 
			two player game where each player controls a limited arsenal of rocks, papers, and
			scissors that they must play against each other. The object of the game is to capture all of the
			weapons in your opponentâ€™s arsenal." Additionally, it retains the fundamental principles of Rock Paper Scissors.
			Enjoy!
